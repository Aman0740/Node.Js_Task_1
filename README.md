### 1. Importing Required Modules:
- The code begins by importing the `express` module, which is used to create the API server. It also imports a `students` array from an external file (likely the same file since it's defined at the end of this snippet).

### 2. Creating the Express Application:
- An Express application (`app`) is created by calling `express()`.
- The `express.json()` middleware is used, allowing the API to parse incoming JSON requests, making it easier to work with JSON data in the request bodies.

### 3. Starting the Server:
- The server is set to listen on port `4000`. When the server starts successfully, it logs a message to the console.

### 4. Defining Routes:
- **Root Route (`GET /`)**:
  - When the root URL (`/`) is accessed, it returns a JSON response with a message saying "API is working".

- **Get All Students (`GET /api/students`)**:
  - This route returns a JSON response containing the entire `students` array, essentially listing all students.

- **Add a New Student (`POST /api/students`)**:
  - This route handles the creation of a new student. 
  - It checks if the `email` field is provided in the request body. If not, it sends a 400 status code with an error message.
  - If the `email` is provided, a new student object is created with the provided data, assigned an `id`, and added to the `students` array. The new student object is then returned in the response.

- **Update an Existing Student (`PUT /api/students/:id`)**:
  - This route updates a student's information based on their `id`.
  - It extracts the `id` from the URL parameters and finds the corresponding student in the `students` array.
  - If the student exists, their details are updated with the data from the request body, and the updated student object is returned.
  - If the student with the given `id` does not exist, it returns a 404 status code indicating that the resource was not found.

- **Delete a Student (`DELETE /api/students/:id`)**:
  - This route deletes a student based on their `id`.
  - It finds the student in the `students` array using the `id` and removes them from the array if they exist.
  - The deleted student object is returned in the response. If the student with the given `id` does not exist, it returns a 404 status code.

### 5. Student Data:
- The `students` array is initialized with 10 student objects, each containing `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `gender`, and `ip_address` properties. This array is the data source for the API.

### 6. Exporting the Students Array:
- Finally, the `students` array is exported using `module.exports`, which makes it available for use in other files (though it's not necessary in this specific code since it's defined and used in the same file).
